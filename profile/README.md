## Computer Simulation & Gaming 
This course is a core component of the [**Computer Simulation & Gaming (CSG)**](https://utulsa.edu/programs/computer-simulation-gaming/) program at the **University of Tulsa**. It builds on the programâ€™s interdisciplinary approach by providing essential skills in advanced programming and system optimization. As students tackle game systems development, they are aligning their learning with the broader goals of the CSG program.
